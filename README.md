# 3D-Unity-Test-Number-1
3D Mechanical and Visual Test in Unity (URP).
This is a little prototype where I've been exploring some of Unity's features in 3D Space.
Stuff I've done so far:
- Modeled, riged, and UV'd a simple robot in Blender.
- Animated Robot using imported animations from Mixamo.
- Set up a duo state machine system to make use of Inverse Kinematics (Animation Rigging package) in conjunction with base animations.
- Implemented Movement, Jumping, Dashing, Sprinting, and Wall-Jumps
- Implemented bullets using Unity's Shuriken Particle System
- Implemented a number of effects using Shader Graph and VFX Graph (Toon Shading, Water, and a bunch of flashy stuff)

At the moment, it looks something like this:
